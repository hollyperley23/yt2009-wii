## changes

- A new API,

- /feeds/api/thumbnails/*/results 

- /feeds/api/thumbnails/*/users

- /feeds/api/thumbnails/*/playlists

- /feeds/api/thumbnails/*

- most subcribed channels feed (forgot which one)

- reads the feed and sends its <media:thumbnail yt:name='poster' url='http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VcJmb3VNFXo/0.jpg' height='240' width='320' time='00:00:00'/>, and redircts.
it is used for the leanback_ajax, which is used for the wii.

- WebM Support 

- using get_webm and get_wii_video will get you a video in WebMs with VP8/OGG in order to get videos to play properly on the Wii.

- Leanback Lite and Leanback Lite Wii patched.

- views are in playlists gdata

---

## already have an instance 

- replace your back folder with this fork's folder (or just replace backend.js, yt2009warpSWF.js, and add yt2009webm.js)
- replace your site-assets folder (in assets) with the fork's folder (or just replace leanback.json)

- then follow along with [wii_setup.md](wii_setup.md) for the rest of the setup.

## setup
### if you prefer using docker rather than installing directly, go [here](docker.md) for setup instructions instead

- **make sure you have [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in your PATH.**

### when installing imagemagick, make sure you also install its legacy tools (convert)! 

- install node.js
- open a terminal (windows powershell/cmd) in the directory you cloned yt2009 to, then:
- install required dependencies with: `npm install`
- create a config file by launching and following: `node yt2009setup.js` (make sure your port is either 443 or 80)
- run to set and download remaining assets `node post_config_setup.js` 
- run yt2009 by changing directory to `back` (`cd back`) and starting with `node backend.js`
- navigate to your IP:port you have set while configuring to see a 2009 homepage.

afterwards, you can just `cd back` and `node backend.js` to start. no need to re-set it up each time.

- then follow along with [wii_setup.md](wii_setup.md) for the rest of the setup.

## updating

if you want to update your frontend instance, use

```
git pull --no-commit
```

to get you up with updates you may have missed.

if you modified the code yourself and you're getting a merge conflict, use

```
git checkout -- <file>
```

to restore the original file. you can make a copy of your modified file and reapply the mod after the pull is done.

## usage

now that you're in, you can just use it as it is, but there is a bit more you can do.

navigate to **/flags** to change settings locally. here, for example, you can set up The Wayback Machine as a video data source. but look through, there is a lot more.

feel free to nav to **/toggle_f** if you've set up flash players as described above to make the frontend work on older browsers, such as ie6.

and just click around! you might find some useful features you didn't expect to work.

---

**over time, depending on your usage, yt2009 may take up a lot of space (counted in tens of gigabytes!)**

**if you need to reclaim space, look through the assets folder where downloaded files (such as images, videos) are saved and delete ones you need.**

**they will be redownloaded when necessary.**

## notes, docs

over time some tools and documentation was written about yt2009. for an easy reference, those are listed below.

- [apk_setup.md](apk_setup.md) - set early youtube android APKs to work with yt2009
- [config_params.md](config_params.md) - a list of ALL available config options.
- [docker.md](docker.md) - yt2009 setup with docker. also listed in the setup section. (thanks, breakgimme!)
- [flash_additions.md](flash_additions.md) - some info on caption and annotations modules within the default 2009 flash player.
- [flash_player_patch.md](flash_player_patch.md) - manual patch info for using flash players with yt2009.


- [autoapk.js](autoapk.js) - a node cli file to automatically patch APKs supported by yt2009. your mileage may vary.
