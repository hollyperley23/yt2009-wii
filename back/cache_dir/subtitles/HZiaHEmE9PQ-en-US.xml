have been stuck asking,</text><text start="20.82" dur="2.94">do I go for a Windows
laptop or a Chromebook?</text><text start="23.76" dur="3.15">Knowing that niether of them
can fully match the features</text><text start="26.91" dur="2.94">of the other, and that
once they pick a path</text><text start="29.85" dur="1.8">they&amp;#39;re completely locked in</text><text start="31.65" dur="2.67">until they replace the whole machine.</text><text start="34.32" dur="3.12">And, it&amp;#39;s so frustrating,
because the actual hardware</text><text start="37.44" dur="3.09">in these computers, is
especially in some cases,</text><text start="40.53" dur="2.613">darn near identical!</text><text start="44.82" dur="2.34">At least, that&amp;#39;s how it has been.</text><text start="47.16" dur="3.81">This summer, Google reversed

our team to bring</text><text start="78.78" dur="3.06">in any old laptops they could find, to see</text><text start="81.84" dur="3.54">if Google could breathe new

buying you a computer that</text><text start="162.33" dur="1.14">won&amp;#39;t be connected to the internet.</text><text start="163.47" dur="3.976">But, it&amp;#39;s so cumbersome and
slow that it didn&amp;#39;t help.</text><text start="167.446" dur="1.604">- I bought it anticipating</text><text start="169.05" dur="1.92">that I would do a lot more traveling</text><text start="170.97" dur="1.35">than I&amp;#39;ve ended up doing.</text><text start="172.32" dur="2.31">- This is like, my school computer.</text><text start="174.63" dur="3.03">I got it because is like,
it just so gigantic.</text><text start="177.66" dur="0.84">- [Adam] So what we&amp;#39;re gonna do</text><text start="178.5" dur="2.52">is that we&amp;#39;re gonna

we might get from Chrome OS,</text><text start="189.24" dur="1.77">we need to do some baseline testing</text><text start="191.01" dur="2.34">before we install
Google&amp;#39;s operating system.</text><text start="193.35" dur="2.7">And, that&amp;#39;s gonna be a
little trickier than usual</text><text start="196.05" dur="3.87">because Chrome OS does not
have the same robust suite</text><text start="199.92" dur="2.85">of benchmarking tools,
that PC enthusiasts have</text><text start="202.77" dur="2.28">come to expect on Windows machines.</text><text start="205.05" dur="2.64">But, we did find a few
browser based benchmarks,</text><text start="207.69" dur="1.44">and we were able to create some</text><text start="209.13" dur="3.9">of our own real world
benchmarks to fill in the gaps.</text><text start="213.03" dur="3.6">First up, we measured how long
it took to boot the device,</text><text start="216.63" dur="3.3">open a browser, and start
watching a YouTube video.</text><text start="219.93" dur="1.47">You know the basics.</text><text start="221.4" dur="2.13">We also timed waking up from sleep,</text><text start="223.53" dur="2.76">tested the number of chrome
tabs each could handle.</text><text start="226.29" dur="2.37">We&amp;#39;re calling 36 tabs a pass.</text><text start="228.66" dur="3.36">And, counted how many
concurrent 1080p streams</text><text start="232.02" dur="2.64">we could get running without any stutters.</text><text start="234.66" dur="2.61">We then followed this up
a battery test, to see</text><text start="237.27" dur="2.52">if Chrome OS can not only
make your system faster,</text><text start="239.79" dur="2.16">but also run longer.</text><text start="241.95" dur="2.914">And, just how slow are these computers?</text><text start="244.864" dur="0.866">(laughs)</text><text start="245.73" dur="1.098">Pretty bad.</text><text start="246.828" dur="1.872">Lloyd&amp;#39;s old MacBook took</text><text start="248.7" dur="3.69">almost 30 seconds to wake from sleep.</text><text start="252.39" dur="2.97">Sleep? More like mostly dead.</text><text start="255.36" dur="2.58">And, Horts&amp;#39;s HP G56?</text><text start="257.94" dur="3.75">That took over five minutes
to reach YouTube thanks to</text><text start="261.69" dur="4.38">its ungodly slow 3,200 RPM hard drive.</text><text start="266.07" dur="1.11">Making matters worse,</text><text start="267.18" dur="2.947">it only managed a single 720p stream</text><text start="270.127" dur="2.123">before giving up the ghost.</text><text start="272.25" dur="2.88">As for performance in a
browser, in our tabs test,</text><text start="275.13" dur="3.84">the HP and ASUS units almost
got a pass crashing out right</text><text start="278.97" dur="2.61">near the finish line,
with Lloyd&amp;#39;s pretty much</text><text start="281.58" dur="2.1">blowing its engine right
out of the starting gate.</text><text start="283.68" dur="2.97">Failing at a truly pathetic four tabs.</text><text start="286.65" dur="1.83">Then in our 1080p playback test,</text><text start="288.48" dur="1.5">Jamie and Adam P&amp;#39;s machines</text><text start="289.98" dur="2.67">both managed four 1080p YouTube streams</text><text start="292.65" dur="2.52">with no drop frames while Horst&amp;#39;s</text><text start="295.17" dur="1.44">and Lloyd&amp;#39;s devices failed</text><text start="296.61" dur="2.85">to play even a single stream at full HD.</text><text start="299.46" dur="1.35">In the battery test,</text><text start="300.81" dur="3.09">every machine sucked,
frankly, but that&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="303.9" dur="3.33">of expected given the age of
the cells in these devices.</text><text start="307.23" dur="1.92">The MacBook does take its first W here</text><text start="309.15" dur="3.27">though at nearly three hours
of time away from the wall.</text><text start="312.42" dur="2.13">We also ran our canned
benchmarks, but we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text><text start="314.55" dur="2.64">about those a little bit
later since it&amp;#39;s already clear</text><text start="317.19" dur="2.94">that some of these computers
are struggling hard.</text><text start="320.13" dur="2.22">Maybe Chrome OS is the medicine they need.</text><text start="322.35" dur="1.59">So, let&amp;#39;s get started.</text><text start="323.94" dur="3.6">The Chrome OS Flex install
process is less than elegant,</text><text start="327.54" dur="3.3">but if you&amp;#39;re chrome curious
and halfway tech savvy,</text><text start="330.84" dur="1.8">you should be able to grab a USB stick</text><text start="332.64" dur="1.74">and follow along at home.</text><text start="334.38" dur="1.74">When you Google Chrome OS Flex,</text><text start="336.12" dur="2.61">you get taken to a Google Enterprise site</text><text start="338.73" dur="3.18">you then click try Chrome OS flex and,</text><text start="341.91" dur="3.84">it asks you to sign up and
fill in your company&amp;#39;s details?</text><text start="345.75" dur="1.62">You can safely ignore that.</text><text start="347.37" dur="2.97">What you actually want is
this little link right here.</text><text start="350.34" dur="2.52">Then, it takes you to
an installation guide.</text><text start="352.86" dur="3.09">Great. But, you need to
download a Chrome extension</text><text start="355.95" dur="2.58">to create the installation media.</text><text start="358.53" dur="3.21">Seems kind of random, but
there is a reason for it.</text><text start="361.74" dur="3.54">It&amp;#39;s because this is
actually a Chrome recovery</text><text start="365.28" dur="1.59">tool that&amp;#39;s designed to repair</text><text start="366.87" dur="3.27">your existing Chrome OS
install on your Chromebook.</text><text start="370.14" dur="2.16">They&amp;#39;ve just repurposed it.</text><text start="372.3" dur="0.833">At this point,</text><text start="373.133" dur="2.317">it confusingly asks you
to choose from a selection</text><text start="375.45" dur="2.13">of Chromebooks, and it&amp;#39;s here</text><text start="377.58" dur="1.92">that you select Chrome OS Flex,</text><text start="379.5" dur="2.7">and then target your preferred USB drive.</text><text start="382.2" dur="3.854">Note that this will wipe out
any other data on that drive.</text><text start="386.054" dur="2.206">Once you&amp;#39;ve created
your installation media,</text><text start="388.26" dur="3.78">you can plug her into your
device and non-destructively boot</text><text start="392.04" dur="2.64">from the USB drive to try out the OS.</text><text start="394.68" dur="0.833">And, at this point</text><text start="395.513" dur="1.267">I could see you thinking,</text><text start="396.78" dur="2.61">this is super cool,
maybe I&amp;#39;ll dual boot it.</text><text start="399.39" dur="1.824">Hold it right there!</text><text start="401.214" dur="3.186">If you decide that you
want to install Chrome OS</text><text start="404.4" dur="2.04">to your SSD or your hard drive,</text><text start="406.44" dur="2.43">rather than running it off of a USB stick,</text><text start="408.87" dur="4.11">you need to know that for
some, probably stupid reason,</text><text start="412.98" dur="3.06">Google&amp;#39;s Chrome OS Flex installer does not</text><text start="416.04" dur="3.51">allow you to choose where to install it.</text><text start="419.55" dur="2.37">So, even if you&amp;#39;ve set up one partition</text><text start="421.92" dur="2.4">for Windows and one for Chrome OS,</text><text start="424.32" dur="2.58">it will wipe out both of them.</text><text start="426.9" dur="3.93">Eliminating all of your data,
making matters even worse,</text><text start="430.83" dur="3.6">if you have two completely
separate physical drives,</text><text start="434.43" dur="2.34">it might target the empty one,</text><text start="436.77" dur="2.67">or it might target your main drive</text><text start="439.44" dur="2.43">and completely wipe out its data.</text><text start="441.87" dur="1.41">You&amp;#39;ve been warned.</text><text start="443.28" dur="3.42">So, make sure you&amp;#39;ve iether
backed up everything important,</text><text start="446.7" dur="2.04">or as an alternative, you can whip</text><text start="448.74" dur="2.82">out your handy dandy LTT
screw driver, available</text><text start="451.56" dur="2.91">in four colorways, and
remove your main drive,</text><text start="454.47" dur="1.35">so you can keep your data safe</text><text start="455.82" dur="2.34">while you install Chrome
OS on the spare one.</text><text start="458.16" dur="3.36">That is not okay, ya bunch of Googlers.</text><text start="461.52" dur="2.79">What is okay is our test results.</text><text start="464.31" dur="2.61">Sorry, spoiler, but it&amp;#39;s the truth.</text><text start="466.92" dur="1.08">They&amp;#39;re not great.</text><text start="468" dur="1.47">Just, okay.</text><text start="469.47" dur="1.74">Let&amp;#39;s start with the canned benchmarks</text><text start="471.21" dur="1.32">that we mentioned earlier.</text><text start="472.53" dur="2.82">WebGL Aquarium, it&amp;#39;s a bit of a mixed bag,</text><text start="475.35" dur="2.43">with both our ThinkPad
and our ASUS machine</text><text start="477.78" dur="2.52">recording drops in performance.</text><text start="480.3" dur="3.51">While Horst&amp;#39;s HP took a huge leap forward.</text><text start="483.81" dur="3.48">Then, in Whirple HTML 5,
the story is the same,</text><text start="487.29" dur="3.45">with only the HP improving
in any meaningful way.</text><text start="490.74" dur="3.42">In Speedometer 2.1, our story
gets even less compelling,</text><text start="494.16" dur="2.58">and we see a consistent
drop in performance</text><text start="496.74" dur="1.74">across all devices.</text><text start="498.48" dur="2.76">Chrome OS isn&amp;#39;t looking so hot.</text><text start="501.24" dur="2.73">But, maybe this reigned
in performance is one</text><text start="503.97" dur="3.96">of the ways that Chrome OS
manages better battery life?</text><text start="507.93" dur="3.93">Well, if our testing is
anything to go by, sorry Chief.</text><text start="511.86" dur="1.14">Not really.</text><text start="513" dur="2.04">The three laptops that we could measure,</text><text start="515.04" dur="4.56">all performed similarly to
Windows, but slightly worse.</text><text start="519.6" dur="2.73">And, this was probably the
biggest surprise for us,</text><text start="522.33" dur="2.67">because anecdotes from
around the web have suggested</text><text start="525" dur="3.54">that Chrome OS Flex should
have a huge, positive impact</text><text start="528.54" dur="1.02">on battery life.</text><text start="529.56" dur="3.84">With some people
reporting 25 to 50% gains.</text><text start="533.4" dur="2.22">Maybe on these models, Chrome OS</text><text start="535.62" dur="2.97">didn&amp;#39;t automatically kick
on power saving mode?</text><text start="538.59" dur="2.4">Or, maybe their battery
life tests were run</text><text start="540.99" dur="1.62">under different conditions.</text><text start="542.61" dur="2.97">I can&amp;#39;t say, all I know
is that at the moment,</text><text start="545.58" dur="1.41">Chrome OS Flex is feeling</text><text start="546.99" dur="2.91">a little more like Chrome OS flacid.</text><text start="549.9" dur="2.64">Fortunately, these lower
scores that we&amp;#39;ve seen so</text><text start="552.54" dur="2.7">far do not tell the whole story.</text><text start="555.24" dur="2.52">The experience of using these devices</text><text start="557.76" dur="3.39">improved massively across the board.</text><text start="561.15" dur="3.18">And, you can see that
in our real world tests.</text><text start="564.33" dur="1.83">Look at these boot times.</text><text start="566.16" dur="3.27">To be clear, a minute,
it&amp;#39;s still pretty slow,</text><text start="569.43" dur="4.44">but it&amp;#39;s a lot faster than
five minutes and 45 seconds.</text><text start="573.87" dur="4.41">We also saw more 1080p streams
on every single device.</text><text start="578.28" dur="2.97">Faster wake from sleep, more tabs,</text><text start="581.25" dur="2.7">and just subjectively, less chugging</text><text start="583.95" dur="2.01">while navigating the operating system.</text><text start="585.96" dur="3.18">But don&amp;#39;t listen to me,
listen to our volunteers.</text><text start="589.14" dur="1.473">- Whoa.</text><text start="591.81" dur="3">Wow. It&amp;#39;s like a different laptop.</text><text start="594.81" dur="2.375">- Woo. Oh my goodness, that is fast.</text><text start="597.185" dur="1.345">(laughs)</text><text start="598.53" dur="1.26">- Oh, that&amp;#39;s pretty fast.</text><text start="599.79" dur="2.16">- The Q key has stopped working.</text><text start="601.95" dur="0.833">That&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="602.783" dur="1.327">- [Adam] Yeah, there&amp;#39;s something
wrong with the keyboard.</text><text start="604.11" dur="2.1">- Yeah, if you could fix the
keyboard, then this would be</text><text start="606.21" dur="2.31">a solid, like write your novel</text><text start="608.52" dur="2.13">at Starbucks sort of computer.</text><text start="610.65" dur="1.68">- Does the track pad work, too?</text><text start="612.33" dur="2.28">Oh, so it does, cool.</text><text start="614.61" dur="1.77">And, the nub works?</text><text start="616.38" dur="4.56">Sorry, the track point
works perfectly fine.</text><text start="620.94" dur="2.333">- [Adam] Hey, look at that.
It&amp;#39;s running Chrome OS now.</text><text start="624.107" dur="2.143">- It&amp;#39;s the click work.</text><text start="626.25" dur="1.83">- [Adam] I have unfortunate news for you.</text><text start="628.08" dur="0.833">- What?</text><text start="628.913" dur="0.967">- [Adam] Chrome OS does not work.</text><text start="629.88" dur="0.95">- Oh (laughs) okay.</text><text start="632.04" dur="3.45">- Ah, that. The keen item
on you might have noticed</text><text start="635.49" dur="2.58">that Lloyd&amp;#39;s MacBook
was conspicuously absent</text><text start="638.07" dur="1.44">from our test results.</text><text start="639.51" dur="2.37">And, this seems like as
good a time as any to</text><text start="641.88" dur="3.63">mention the minimum requirements
for running Chrome OS Flex.</text><text start="645.51" dur="2.688">You will need an X 86 64
bit compatible device,</text><text start="648.198" dur="3.462">four gigs of RAM, and 16
gigs of internal storage.</text><text start="651.66" dur="3.03">With the final caveat
being, that components made</text><text start="654.69" dur="4.32">before 2010 may result
in a poor experience.</text><text start="659.01" dur="1.68">But, all of that is well</text><text start="660.69" dur="2.13">below the specs of Lloyd&amp;#39;s old MacBook.</text><text start="662.82" dur="1.92">So, what&amp;#39;s the deal here?</text><text start="664.74" dur="3.81">Well, the thing is, you might
also have a poor experience</text><text start="668.55" dur="4.47">if you install Chrome OS Flex
on a non-certified device.</text><text start="673.02" dur="3.09">Jamie&amp;#39;s ThinkPad here, was
actually our only device</text><text start="676.11" dur="4.11">that happened to be on Google&amp;#39;s
list, and it worked so well</text><text start="680.22" dur="1.29">that it might as well
have been a Chromebook</text><text start="681.51" dur="2.1">in the first place. Almost.</text><text start="683.61" dur="1.74">We&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a second.</text><text start="685.35" dur="2.55">As for the others, we
saw issues that ranged</text><text start="687.9" dur="3.51">from mildly annoying, like
mislabeled function keys</text><text start="691.41" dur="3.18">or nonfunctioning volume
controls, all the way to</text><text start="694.59" dur="1.47">completely game breaking.</text><text start="696.06" dur="2.04">Like, not handing off rendering</text><text start="698.1" dur="2.52">to the dedicated GPU on Lloyd&amp;#39;s MacBook,</text><text start="700.62" dur="2.76">even though, we could tell
that Chrome OS was totally</text><text start="703.38" dur="2.67">still running behind that blank screen.</text><text start="706.05" dur="1.74">- Do you want to activate Chrome Box</text><text start="707.79" dur="2.76">the built in screen reader for Chrome OS?</text><text start="710.55" dur="2.28">If so, press the space bar.</text><text start="712.83" dur="1.62">- It&amp;#39;s important to note, that even</text><text start="714.45" dur="2.88">if you install Chrome OS
Flex on a certified device,</text><text start="717.33" dur="3.69">it doesn&amp;#39;t quite have all the
features of regular Chrome OS.</text><text start="721.02" dur="4.56">And, the big one here is no
support for Android apps.</text><text start="725.58" dur="1.2">That reduces your options</text><text start="726.78" dur="3.09">for non-web apps to basically zilch,</text><text start="729.87" dur="3.27">and is a huge hit to the
versatility of these things.</text><text start="733.14" dur="2.28">Your zombie Chromebook
also won&amp;#39;t get features</text><text start="735.42" dur="2.46">that are exclusive to
Google certified devices</text><text start="737.88" dur="2.52">like access to their Linux Shell.</text><text start="740.4" dur="2.4">Of course, you tinkery
types can remedy this</text><text start="742.8" dur="2.4">by using something called
the Brunch Framework.</text><text start="745.2" dur="2.43">It&amp;#39;s a community project
that uses an official</text><text start="747.63" dur="2.01">recovery image to install Chrome OS</text><text start="749.64" dur="2.16">on any X 64 device,</text><text start="751.8" dur="2.07">but without any of the limitations</text><text start="753.87" dur="2.58">that Google imposes on Chrome OS Flex.</text><text start="756.45" dur="2.31">So, at the very least, you
get your Android apps back,</text><text start="758.76" dur="3.87">which is a big plus, since
it&amp;#39;s honestly kind of confusing</text><text start="762.63" dur="2.31">that Google locked it
off in the first place.</text><text start="764.94" dur="1.29">We didn&amp;#39;t have a chance to give</text><text start="766.23" dur="1.29">Brunch Framework a shot though.</text><text start="767.52" dur="2.76">So, those of you who have, let
us know what your experience</text><text start="770.28" dur="2.43">was like in the comments down below.</text><text start="772.71" dur="2.79">Bottom line, would we
recommend Chrome OS Flex?</text><text start="775.5" dur="3.63">Well, even with the installation
caveats, actually, yeah.</text><text start="779.13" dur="2.94">It really can breathe new
life into an old device,</text><text start="782.07" dur="3.24">and is great if you just need
something that&amp;#39;s easy to lock</text><text start="785.31" dur="3.24">down to give to a child,
or you want a device</text><text start="788.55" dur="2.46">for light computing
tasks around the house.</text><text start="791.01" dur="2.61">If nothing else, it
takes about 15 minutes to</text><text start="793.62" dur="2.1">get the installer onto a USB to try out.</text><text start="795.72" dur="2.13">So, it&amp;#39;s at least worth giving it a shot.</text><text start="797.85" dur="2.28">And, if Chrome OS isn&amp;#39;t your thing,</text><text start="800.13" dur="1.8">hey, there&amp;#39;s lots of other options.</text><text start="801.93" dur="2.52">You could go with a lightweight
Linux distro like Lubuntu</text><text start="804.45" dur="3.75">or antiX, or if you
wanna stick with Windows,</text><text start="808.2" dur="4.44">the single best upgrade for
older devices is an SSD.</text><text start="812.64" dur="2.85">Jamie&amp;#39;s 10 year old
ThinkPad felt like a totally</text><text start="815.49" dur="2.07">different machine with a
solid state drive in it.</text><text start="817.56" dur="2.19">And, we&amp;#39;re gonna throw a couple
